# Observers

ZetaChain has two types of validators: core validators and observer validators
(observers).

Observers are tasked with running nodes of connected chains, observing them with
`zetaclient` and writing transactions to connected chains.

The protocol is designed in a way to allow observers in the future to choose
which chains they want to observe. This allows for a more flexible system where
observers can observe only the subset of chains they are interested in (for
example, their infrastructure is built around running EVM nodes). In the current
version of the protocol, all observers are observing all chains.

A list of [observers](/architecture/modules/observer/overview) on the ZetaChain
testnet:

<ObserverList />

As they perform a critical function in the system, the minimum self
delegation/stake required to be an observer is set as a param of the `observer`
module on a per chain basis. This is to ensure that observers are incentivized
to perform their duties and are not malicious.

<ObserverParams />
